# Spring 2021 Code

These files corresponds with the code I (Michelle Lee) wrote during the Spring 2021 semester, during which I participated in independent study with Professor Zachary Dodds.

I have folders corresponding to the progress I made for each week. Some files are duplicated, but may have different file names. The code in this folder will be gradually integrated into the main code folders.

This folder also contains other materials, such as keynote presentations (progress reports), and a video demo-ing the process of generating a protocol from the Panda3D GUI (legacy of a different project).
